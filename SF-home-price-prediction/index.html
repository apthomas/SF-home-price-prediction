            <h2>Comparison of IPO's</h2>
            <p> <strong> Silicon Valley is one of the world’s most liveable areas. One of the key's to that liveability, is our ability to buy a home and create roots.  How will recently filed IPO's effect this?</strong></p>
            <p class="lead">"Everybody is getting pumped about the new wave of tech IPOs in 2019 and 2020. These SF Bay Area tech IPOs include Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, Slack, Pinterest, and more.</p>
            <p> The default assumption is that these tech IPOs will bring in huge demand and drive SF Bay Area real estate prices up. After all, these soon-to-be public companies are worth billions and employ tens of thousands of sub-35 year-old-employees looking to establish roots." - Financial Samurai </p>
            <p> Most real estate agents in the Bay Area mention the IPO's as the single biggest reason to buy property NOW. I've been told "Buy now or you might never be able to" numerous times.</p>
            <p> Let's inspect how the current IPO's in Silicon Valley compare to those of the last 20 years.</p>
            <div class="spacing-graph"></div>

            <h2> Market Perspective</h2>
            <p> <strong>How does our current situation compare to the past? Particularly, the dot com boom? </strong></p>
            <p> Prior to 2019, tech companies have stayed private longer than they have in the past, and they’re worth more than ever. However, the floodgates are now open and 2019 has
                taken the throne as the year with the most and biggest IPO's in Silicon Valley. It's shaping up to even surpass the dot-com boom of 1999.</p>

            <h2>Predicted Home Value Patchwork</h2>
            <p> <strong>How will this effect the median home values across the area? </strong></p>
            <p> Given this large expected surge in demand, I have predicted the median home values across Silicon Valley by Zipcode.
                In the valley, there exists great variations in median income, demographic information, and home prices across Zipcode's, even those that are right neighbors.</p>

            <p>
                These new millionaires will be starting families and investing in locations where they can build their lives and futures, so the variance in home prices across zip codes will grow.
                Now, given these findings - the dark blue regions are those likely to see the highest home value growth.</p>
